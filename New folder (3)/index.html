            <p> methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research.
                Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves.</p>

            <p class="text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
                deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
                imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As
                cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation,
                formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.</p>

            <p> Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.</p>

            <p class="text-small">After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate
                scholarship in Western Europe.The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as
                centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval
                universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities. During the High Middle Ages,
                Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval
                universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged
                freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including
                Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early
                expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a
                pioneer of biological field research.[11] Founded in 1088, the University of Bologne is considered the
                first, and the oldest continually operating university.</p>
